description: |
    A `Face` represents the face of a [Block].

    It can be returned when casting a ray, to know which block face has been touched. (see [Impact.FaceTouched](/reference/impact#property-facetouched))

    It's also a useful parameter to functions like [Block.AddNeighbor](/reference/block#functions-addneighbor), to indicate where to place a [Block] next to another.

    Builtin `Face` instances can be used, there's no way to create custom Faces.
