description: "OtherPlayers is an array of Players that contains all players except the local one."
blocks:
  - text: |
      [OtherPlayers] is a [array] containing all [Player]s currently connected to the [World], except the local one.
    
      [OtherPlayers] is not available to the [Server], because it just wouldn't make sense! ðŸ™‚

      Player indexes in [OtherPlayers] are arbitrary, and may change as players join and leave.

  - code: |
      -- print information about all other players:
      for _, player in OtherPlayers do
        print(player.Username, player.UserID, player.ConnectionID)
      end

      -- another way to iterate:
      for i = 1, #OtherPlayers do
        local player = OtherPlayers[i]
        print(player.Username, player.UserID, player.ConnectionID)
      end
