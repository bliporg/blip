    - name: "SkyLightFactor"
      type: "number"

          Factor representing what fraction of sky light color [Sky.SkyLightColor](/reference/sky#property-skylightcolor) will contribute to dynamic ambient color, default `0.1`.

    - name: "DirectionalLightFactor"
      type: "number"
      description: |
          Factor representing what fraction of the scene's directional lights color [Light.Color](/reference/light#property-color) will contribute to dynamic ambient color, default `0.2`.

    - name: "Color"
