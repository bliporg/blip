    An [Animation] is a set of keyframes groups that can be used to animate any object or group of objects, such as animating a character or creating a cutscene.

    Each keyframes group is bound to animating one object, it can be toggled on or off individually to disable part of an animation.
    For example, a running animation could temporarily toggle off the keyframes group bound to an arm to simultaneously play a wave animation on that arm.
constructors: 
  - description: |
        When created, an [Animation] can be given a name and a set of optional configuration `{ duration, speed, count}`.
        They are used to initialize the corresponding properties [Duration](#property-duration), [Speed](#property-speed) and [Count](#property-count).

    arguments:
      - name: "name"
        type: "string"
        optional: true
      - name: "config"
        type: "table"
        optional: true

properties:
  - name: "Duration"
    type: "number"
    description: "Duration in seconds of one animation cycle."
    
  - name: "Speed"
    type: "number"
    description: "Speed of one animation cycle. This is the inverse of [Duration](#property-duration), you can choose to set one or the other."

  - name: "Count"
    type: "number"
    description: "Number of cycles to repeat the animation. The default count of `1` will play a full cycle once. Setting this to `0` will repeat the animation indefenitely."

  - name: "IsPlaying"
    type: "boolean"
    description: "Whether or not the animation is currently playing."

functions:
  - name: "Play"
    description: "Starts or resumes the animation."
  
  - name: "PlayReverse"
    description: "Reverse, then starts or resumes the animation."

  - name: "Stop"
    description: "Stops and resets the animation."
  
  - name: "Pause"
    description: "Pauses the animation."
  
  - name: "Tick"
    description: |
        Steps the animation one tick. This is typically to be called inside [Client].[Tick](/reference/client#functions-tick) or [Object].[Tick](/reference/object#functions-tick).

        ⚠️ This needs to be called manually currently. In a future version, it may be done automatically.
  
  - name: "AddFrameInGroup"
    description: |
        Add a keyframe to the group identified by its name, at a given weight, for a transformation of any or all of position, rotation and scale through the last parameter `{ position, rotation, scale }`.

        The weight can be any number, allowing you to organize keyframes relative to each others' weight.
        Keyframes are then played in order of increasing weight.

        Note that when the animation is played for the first time, keyframes weights are automatically normalized.
    arguments:
      - name: "name"
        type: "string"
      - name: "weight"
        type: "number"
      - name: "transform"
        type: "table"

  - name: "Bind"
    description: |
        Binds a keyframes group identified by its name to the given object. It means whenever this animation is played, that particular group of keyframes will modify the bound object.
    arguments:
      - name: "name"
        type: "string"
      - name: "target"
        type: "Object"
  
  - name: "Toggle"
    description: |
        Toggles a keyframes group identified by its name. Whenever this animation is played, that particular group of keyframes will not be used until toggled back on.
    arguments:
      - name: "name"
        type: "string"
      - name: "toggle"
        type: "boolean"
  
  - name: "AddOnPlayCallback"
    description: |
        Register a function to be called any time the animation is played.
    arguments:
      - name: "callback"
        type: "function"

  - name: "RemoveOnPlayCallback"
    description: |
        Unregister a function that was previously registered with [AddOnPlayCallback](#functions-addonplaycallback).
    arguments:
      - name: "callback"
        type: "function"
  
  - name: "AddOnStopCallback"
    description: |
        Register a function to be called any time the animation is stopped.
    arguments:
      - name: "callback"
        type: "function"

  - name: "RemoveOnStopCallback"
    description: |
        Unregister a function that was previously registered with [AddOnStopCallback](#functions-addonplaycallback).
