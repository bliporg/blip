        [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh) is a platform where you can quickly build games and distribute them on all platforms (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, web, Discord, and more).

        It can be considered a real open alternative to Roblox.

        This documentation contains everything developers need to know to create Cubzh games. üëæ

    - title: "Cubes"

    - text: |
        In [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh), <u>everything</u> is made out of cubes. Terrain, avatars, items, vehicles... everything!

        Mainly because it's quick and easy to create game assets with cubes:

        Also because shapes made of 3D aligned cubes makes a pretty good standard for cross-game compatibility: üôÇ

    - title: "Luau"

    - text: |
        [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh) scripts use the Luau programming language.

        [Luau](https://luau.org) is derived from [Lua](https://www.lua.org) (5.1) which is a very solid and lighweight scripting language that's been around since 1993. It's easy to learn and already used by other popular video game platforms like [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com).
    
        A default Lua script is generated when you create a new game. You can launch the game in edit mode and select "Edit code" in the pause menu to see it.

        Don't worry if you're not familiar with it or even a complete code beginner. You'll get started building fun games in minutes. ‚ò∫Ô∏è

    - subtitle: "Quick example: How to jump higher?"

    - text: "Find where `Client.Action1` is defined in the default script:"

    - code: |
        -- function triggered when pressing the Action1 button
        Client.Action1 = function()
            -- Player represents the local player ingame avatar.
            -- Test if Player is on ground before changing velocity,
            -- otherwise, player could jump while in the air. :D
            if Player.IsOnGround then
                Player.Velocity.Y = 50
            end
        end

    - text: "Edit this line:"

    - code: "Player.Velocity.Y = 200 -- changed the value to jump higher"

    - text : |
        Use "Publish" button

        The game will restart for all connected players (including yourself), everyone will now jump higher. üôÇ

    - text: üí° Script comments start with `--`. Comments are not considered when running the script, they're only notes for developers.

    - title: "Realtime multiplayer environment"

    - text : |
        Games in [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh) are realtime multiplayer games by default.

        It means you don't need a single line of code to make that work. It also means you don't have to worry about servers.

        Also, there's always a debug server running as you work on your game. Your friends or random players can join and test things while you write code.

        At any time, you can publish a new version of your game. Game servers are spinned up automatically based on player demand.

    - title: "Truly cross-platform"

    - text : |
        No one should be left aside!

        [Cubzh](https://cu.bzh) runs on Android, iOS, Mac & Windows. (Linux + web browsers coming next)

        While the game is cross-platform, we don't want developers to worry about making sure the game works fine on each one of them.

        For example: a game designed on a desktop computer should be just as playable on mobile (and vice versa).

        The scripting environment has been designed with that philosophy in mind.

        UI elements, inputs, everything will adapt automagically depending on the screen and touch, mouse and/or keyboard events.
